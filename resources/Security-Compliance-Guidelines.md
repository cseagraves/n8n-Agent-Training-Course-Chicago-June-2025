## üè† Real Estate Data Protection Overview

### Types of Sensitive Data in Real Estate
- **Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** Names, addresses, phone numbers, emails
- **Financial Information:** Income, credit scores, bank statements, loan details
- **Transaction Data:** Purchase prices, property details, contract terms
- **Legal Documents:** Contracts, disclosures, inspection reports
- **Biometric Data:** Digital signatures, ID verification
- **Marketing Data:** Client preferences, behavior patterns, communication history

## üîê n8n Security Best Practices

### Credential Management
**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use n8n's built-in credential system exclusively
- Create separate credentials for each service
- Use descriptive names for easy identification
- Test credentials regularly to ensure they're working
- Store API keys directly in n8n - never in workflow nodes
- Enable two-factor authentication on all service accounts

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Hardcode API keys or passwords in workflows
- Share credentials between different projects
- Store sensitive data in workflow variables
- Use personal accounts for business workflows
- Take screenshots of credentials or API keys
- Share workflow exports that contain embedded credentials

### Workflow Security
```json
// ‚úÖ Correct: Use credential references
{
  "authentication": "predefinedCredentialType",
  "nodeCredentialType": "openRouterApi"
}

// ‚ùå Wrong: Hardcoded API key
{
  "apiKey": "sk-or-v1-abc123..."
}
```

### Data Handling in Workflows
- **Minimize data retention:** Process and purge unnecessary data
- **Use secure connections:** Ensure HTTPS/TLS for all API calls
- **Validate inputs:** Check data formats and sanitize user inputs
- **Error handling:** Ensure error messages don't expose sensitive data
- **Logging:** Avoid logging sensitive information in workflow outputs
