## 1. Prompting Fundamentals for Real Estate

### Core Principles

**Be Specific and Contextual**
- ❌ Poor: "Analyze this property"
- ✅ Good: "Analyze this residential property listing for a first-time homebuyer with a budget of $400,000, focusing on investment potential, neighborhood safety, and school district quality"

**Define Your Role and Expertise**
```markdown
You are an expert real estate market analyst with 15 years of experience in [specific market]. You specialize in residential properties and investment analysis.
```

**Set Clear Output Expectations**
```markdown
Provide your analysis in the following format:
1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key Strengths (3 bullet points)
3. Potential Concerns (3 bullet points)
4. Recommendation (Buy/Pass/Negotiate)
5. Suggested Next Actions
```

### The REAL Framework for Real Estate Prompts

**R** - Role (Define the AI's expertise)  
**E** - Evidence (Provide relevant data/context)  
**A** - Action (Specify what you want done)  
**L** - Limits (Set constraints and format)

#### Example Using REAL Framework:
```markdown
**Role:** You are a senior real estate investment advisor specializing in rental properties.

**Evidence:** Property: 123 Main St, 3BR/2BA, $350,000, built 1995, neighborhood median rent $2,800/month, cap rate 7.2%, property taxes $4,200/year.

**Action:** Evaluate this property's investment potential and generate a comprehensive investment analysis.

**Limits:** Response must be under 300 words, include specific ROI calculations, and end with a clear Buy/Hold/Pass recommendation.
